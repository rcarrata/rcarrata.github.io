What is the role of Application Gateway in enabling the secure exposure of customer applications within Private Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) clusters?
How does Application Gateway integrate with Private ARO clusters and align with the connectivity strategy of Open Hybrid Multi-Cloud?
What are the benefits of using Application Gateway for load balancing customer applications within ARO clusters, especially during high demand scenarios?

## Overview

In the dynamic world of hybrid multi-cloud environments, organizations are constantly seeking robust solutions to expose their customer applications securely. In this blog post, we will focus on the critical topic of exposing customer applications within Private Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) clusters and shed light on the pivotal role played by Application Gateway in enabling this process.

Application Gateway, a versatile component of the Azure ecosystem, serves as a powerful tool for secure application exposure. It seamlessly integrates with Private ARO clusters, aligning with the overarching connectivity strategy of Open Hybrid Multi-Cloud.

By leveraging Application Gateway, organizations can unlock a plethora of benefits when it comes to exposing customer applications. Firstly, it acts as a highly efficient load balancer, intelligently distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances of applications running within the ARO cluster. This ensures optimal performance and availability, even during high demand scenarios.

Moreover, Application Gateway provides robust security features, safeguarding customer applications from external threats. It offers comprehensive SSL/TLS termination, enabling end-to-end encryption for enhanced data protection. Additionally, its Web Application Firewall (WAF) functionality protects against common web vulnerabilities, providing an additional layer of defense.

## Azure Application Gateway

[Azure Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview) is a load balancer designed for managing web traffic directed towards your web applications. Unlike traditional load balancers that operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and direct traffic solely based on source IP address and port to a destination IP address and port, Application Gateway goes a step further.

Application Gateway has the capability to make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, such as the URI path or host headers. This means that you can determine the routing of traffic based on the incoming URL. For instance, if the incoming URL contains "/images," you can direct the traffic to a specific pool of servers configured specifically for handling images. On the other hand, if the URL contains "/video," the traffic can be routed to a separate pool that is optimized for video content.
