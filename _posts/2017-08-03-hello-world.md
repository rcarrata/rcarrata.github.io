Finally I have some time to push the first post (and I hope not the last ;D) of my new brand blog.

This blog is my little spot to write my technical experiences with the different products related with IT, not only from Linux or Red Hat, also with other topics that I interested about technology.

I hope that some of these articles that I will post, help someone in some place! This will be awesome! :) 

All opinions, articles, posts and stuff are my write by my own.

Have a good day pals and always have fun! 

BR 

Rober ;)
