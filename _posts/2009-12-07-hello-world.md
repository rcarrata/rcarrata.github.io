OK, this it. Finally I manage to get some time to start my technical blog.

First of all this is not going to a be a blog in the guru style since I don't consider myself a guru. This is going to be a bit of a ragbag, with tips and thoughs from my day to day work and my past experience. Of course it will be focused mainly in HP-UX and virtualization.

Hope you like it, all comments are welcome ;-)
