How you can enable mTLS authentication with OpenShift using the Ingress Controller Operator (without Service Mesh)?
How this is implemented in the Ingress Controller and in the OpenShift Routers? Which are the benefits of implementing mTLS?

Let's dig in!

## 1. Overview

Let's start with the basics. All of us heard, about TLS but which protections and benefits provides?

TLS provides us with two primary protections:

* The first protection, is that TLS encrypts your traffic to protect it from eavesdropping.

* The second is that TLS authenticates the server to the client (and optionally the client to the server as well) with the use of signed certificates.

[![](/images/mtls-ingress.png "mtls ingress 0")]({{site.url}}/images/mtls-ingress.png)

But by default TLS only validates the authenticity of the server and not of the client (application) which is sending the request.

We can use mutual TLS where both clients request certificates from the server to ensure the server is who it says it is, and the server requests certificates from the client to prove who it is as well.

When using mutual authentication, not only does the service side prove its identity by exposing a certificate, but also the clients prove their identity to the servers by exposing a client-side certificate.

This provides a higher level of security compared to normal TLS/HTTPS usage, where only the identity of the server is proven.

From the version 4.9+ of OpenShift we can enable mTLS authentication in the Ingress Controller, and configure them to verify client certificates.

So this involves that, we don't need to be forced to use Service Mesh ONLY for enable the [mTLS authentication](https://rcarrata.com/istio/mtls-service-mesh/)

NOTE: Service Mesh it's marvelous tech that enables tons of other features, as you can discover in the blog post series, so please check them!.

The tests on this blog post are executed in a 4.9.4 OpenShift environment.

## 2. Ingress Operator and Ingress Controller in OpenShift

The Ingress Operator in OpenShift makes it possible for external clients to access your service by deploying and managing one or more HAProxy-based Ingress Controllers to handle routing.

You can use the Ingress Operator to route traffic by specifying OpenShift Container Platform Route and Kubernetes Ingress resources.

As we pointed out in the previous section, from the 4.9 version of OpenShift the [Ingress Controller can enable mTLS authentication](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/networking/ingress-operator.html#nw-mutual-tls-auth_configuring-ingress), and configure the Ingresses (based in Haproxy) to verify the client certificates.

Let's test it with an example and check how this feature can help us with our use cases.

But before to start testing out the mTLS in the Ingress Controller, we need to prepare some prerequisites, like generate CA certificates, client certificates, etc.

## 3. Creating the CA certificate

First we would need a CA certificate which can sign both the client and server certificates.

* So let's create our directory structure to store the CA certificate and key.

```sh
mkdir /tmp/mtls

cd /tmp/mtls

mkdir certs private
```

* Next create an index.txt and serial file to track the list of certificates signed by the CA certificate.

```sh
echo 01 > serial
touch index.txt
```

* Download the openssl.cnf as example:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcarrata/ocp4-network-security/main/mtls-ingress-operator/openssl.cnf
```

* Create **private key**. We would need a private key for the CA certificate:

```sh
openssl genrsa -out private/cakey.pem 4096

Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus (2 primes)
.................++++
...++++
e is 65537 (0x010001)
```

* Set the Common Name (CN) for the CA Cert:

```sh
SUBJ_CACERT="/CN=$(hostname)/ST=Madrid/C=ES/O=None/OU=None"

echo $SUBJ_CACERT
/CN=anubis.rober.lab/ST=Madrid/C=ES/O=None/OU=None
```

I've used for the CN the hostname of my lab host.

* Create **CA certificate**. We will use the generated private key from the step before to generate our CA certificate:

```sh
openssl req -new -subj ${SUBJ_CACERT} -x509 -days 3650 -config openssl.cnf -key private/cakey.pem -out certs/cacert.pem
```

* Convert certificate to PEM format:

```sh
openssl x509 -in certs/cacert.pem -out certs/cacert.pem -outform PEM
```

* Check the CA certificate generated with openssl:

```sh
openssl x509 -in certs/cacert.pem -text -noout

Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number:
            xxxx
        Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN = anubis.rober.lab, ST = Madrid, C = ES, O = None, OU = None
        Validity
            Not Before: Nov 11 20:31:49 2021 GMT
            Not After : Nov  9 20:31:49 2031 GMT
        Subject: CN = anubis.rober.lab, ST = Madrid, C = ES, O = None, OU = None
```

* In the certificate we can identify the Basic Contraints extension:

```sh
openssl x509 -in certs/cacert.pem -text -noout | grep -B4 CA

            X509v3 Authority Key Identifier:
                keyid:xxx

            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:TRUE
```

Typically the application will contain an option to point to an extension section. If critical is present then the extension will be critical.

In this case the CA: TRUE identifies that this certificate is a CA Certificate.

## 4. Create client certificate

Now we will create the client certificate which will be used by the client node.

* Create **private key** for the client certificate. We will again need a different private key for the client certificate.

```sh
openssl genrsa -out private/client.key.pem 4096

Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus (2 primes)
...................++++
.............................................................................................................................................................++++
e is 65537 (0x010001)
```

NOTE: It is important that any CSR you generate either for client or server certificates, should have matching Country Name, State and Organization Name with the CA certificate or else while signing the certificate.

* Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Next we need to generate the CSR for the client certificate. For our CA certificate we had given few details such as Country Name. State, Locality etc.

```sh
SUBJ_CLIENT="/CN=$(hostname)/ST=Madrid/C=ES/O=None/OU=None"

echo $SUBJ_CLIENT
/CN=anubis.rober.lab/ST=Madrid/C=ES/O=None/OU=None
```

```sh
openssl req -new -subj ${SUBJ_CLIENT} -key private/client.key.pem -out certs/client.csr
```

* To check the CSR generated in the step before:

```
openssl req -text -noout -verify -in certs/client.csr

verify OK
Certificate Request:
    Data:
        Version: 1 (0x0)
        Subject: CN = anubis.rober.lab, ST = Madrid, C = ES, O = None, OU = None
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                RSA Public-Key: (4096 bit)
...
```

* Add **certificate extensions**. We will also add some certificate extensions to our client certificate. We will create an additional configuration file with the required extensions:

```sh
cat <<EOF > client_ext.cnf
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
nsCertType = client, email
nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Client Certificate"
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer
keyUsage = critical, nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth, emailProtection
EOF
```

* Next we will create our client certificate:

```sh
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -extfile client_ext.cnf -days 3650 -notext -batch -in certs/client.csr -out certs/client.cert.pem

Using configuration from openssl.cnf
Check that the request matches the signature
Signature ok
Certificate Details:
        Serial Number: 2 (0x2)
        Validity
            Not Before: Nov 11 22:57:09 2021 GMT
            Not After : Nov  9 22:57:09 2031 GMT
        Subject:
            countryName               = ES
            stateOrProvinceName       = Madrid
            organizationName          = None
            organizationalUnitName    = None
            commonName                = anubis.rober.lab
        X509v3 extensions:
            X509v3 Basic Constraints:
                CA:FALSE
            Netscape Cert Type:
                SSL Client, S/MIME
            Netscape Comment:
                OpenSSL Generated Client Certificate
            X509v3 Subject Key Identifier:
                xxx
            X509v3 Authority Key Identifier:
                keyid:xxx

            X509v3 Key Usage: critical
                Digital Signature, Non Repudiation, Key Encipherment
            X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
                TLS Web Client Authentication, E-mail Protection
Certificate is to be certified until Nov  9 22:57:09 2031 GMT (3650 days)

Write out database with 1 new entries
Data Base Updated
```

The path of the CA certificate required to sign the certificate will be picked from the openssl.cnf file.

* Set restricted permissions to the certs:

```sh
chmod 400 certs/client.cert.pem
```

* We can check the client certificate generated:

```sh
openssl x509 -in certs/client.cert.pem -text -noout

Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 2 (0x2)
        Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN = anubis.rober.lab, ST = Madrid, C = ES, O = None, OU = None
        Validity
            Not Before: Nov 11 22:57:09 2021 GMT
            Not After : Nov  9 22:57:09 2031 GMT
        Subject: C = ES, ST = Madrid, O = None, OU = None, CN = anubis.rober.lab
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                RSA Public-Key: (4096 bit)
...
```

as we can see the certificate is signed by of our brand new CA cert as we can check in the Issuer.

* Now we have generated this certificate, the index.txt will be updated reflecting the generated certificate:

```sh
cat index.txt
V       311109225709Z           02      unknown /C=ES/ST=Madrid/O=None/OU=None/CN=anubis.rober.lab
```

* Let's do a bit of housekeeping deleting the csr once we generated the cert:

```sh
rm -rf certs/client.csr
```

## 5. Create Server Certificate

In the mTLS, both server and client are verified, so we need to generate certs for client and server and signed with our CA generated in the first place.

In this blog post only we will be using the client certificate, but in a real environment / scenario we need to generate the certificate to the server and update them in the Ingress Controller.

Let's review the generation of the server certificate for educational purposes (and because sometimes I have bad memory and I need to check how to do it! :D).

* Generate a **private key** for the server certificate:

```sh
openssl genrsa -out private/server.key.pem 4096
```

* Let's extract our domain for the apps in our OpenShift cluster:

```sh
APPS_DOMAIN=$(oc whoami --show-console | cut -f 2- -d '.')

echo $APPS_DOMAIN
apps.ocp.rober.lab
```

* Define the SUBJ SERVER used during the generation of the CSR & Cert:

```sh
SERVER_NAME=*.$APPS_DOMAIN

SUBJ_SERVER="/CN=${SERVER_NAME}/ST=Madrid/C=ES/O=None/OU=None"

echo $SUBJ_SERVER
/CN=*.apps.ocp.rober.lab/ST=Madrid/C=ES/O=None/OU=None
```

* Create **Certificate Signing Request** (CSR) for the server certificate:

```sh
openssl req -new -subj ${SUBJ_SERVER} -key private/server.key.pem -out certs/server.csr
```

* Verify the CSR that we generated:

```sh
openssl req -text -noout -verify -in certs/server.csr

verify OK
Certificate Request:
    Data:
        Version: 1 (0x0)
        Subject: CN = *.apps.ocp.rober.lab, ST = Madrid, C = ES, O = None, OU = None
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                RSA Public-Key: (4096 bit)
```

* Let's extract the IP of the LB of the Baremetal node where is virtualized with KVM + Libvirt the VMs where the OpenShift cluster runs, and that will be the entrypoint towards the *apps and the api of OpenShift cluster:

```sh
SERVER_IP=$(ip addr show eno1 | grep inet | head -n1 | awk '{ print $2 }' | cut -f 1 -d '/')

echo $SERVER_IP
10.1.8.72
```

* Add **certificate extensions**. Similar to client certificate, we will again add some extensions to our server certificate. Additionally we are adding Subject Alternative Name field also known as SAN. This is used to define multiple Common Name.

```sh
cat <<EOF > server_ext.cnf
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
nsCertType = server
nsComment = "OpenSSL Generated Server Certificate"
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer:always
keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
IP.1 = ${SERVER_IP}
DNS.1 = ${SERVER_NAME}
EOF
```

as you can see the SERVER_IP is the IP of my BM node where is allocated the OpenShift cluster virtualized, and we will add also as another SAN.

* Create server certificate. Now we will use this extension file along with the private key and CSR to generate our server certificate:

```sh
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -extfile server_ext.cnf -days 3650 -notext -batch -in certs/server.csr -out certs/server.cert.pem

Using configuration from openssl.cnf
Check that the request matches the signature

```

* Let's modify the permissions of the cert:

```sh
chmod 400 certs/server.cert.pem
```

* Let's do a bit of housekeeping:

```sh
rm -f certs/server.csr
rm -f serial*
rm -f index.*
```

My colleague Luis Arizmendi create a script for automate this steps and its available in [their repo](https://github.com/luisarizmendi/create-self-signed-certs). Great job Luis!

## 6. Test the OpenShift Ingress Controller without the mTLS enabled

Before to enable the mTLS we need to ensure that we can reach properly the OpenShift ingress controller, and we will use the console url because have a secure route with TLS (reencrypt/Redirect):

```sh
 curl -LIv https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp.rober.lab
* Rebuilt URL to: https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp.rober.lab/
*   Trying 192.168.126.1...

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

All seems ok, and the ingress-controller is presenting the default certificate with the wildcard *.apps.ocp.rober that matches the FQDN of the console host url.

## 7. Create CA ConfigMap and enable the mTLS in the IngressController

Now that we have the prerequistes configured, let's move towards the configuration of the mTLS in the Ingress Controller.

As we checked, we can configure the Ingress Controller to enable mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication by setting a spec.clientTLS value.

The clientTLS value configures the Ingress Controller to verify client certificates. This configuration includes setting a clientCA value, which is a reference to a config map.

The config map contains the PEM-encoded CA certificate bundle that is used to verify a client’s certificate.

* Let's create a config map that is in the openshift-config namespace

```sh
kubectl create configmap router-ca-certs-default --from-file=ca-bundle.pem=certs/cacert.pem -n openshift-config

configmap/router-ca-certs-default created
```

* Edit the IngressController resource in the openshift-ingress-operator project:

```sh
kubectl edit IngressController default -n openshift-ingress-operator
```

* Add the spec.clientTLS field and subfields to configure mutual TLS:

```sh
kubectl edit IngressController default -n openshift-ingress-operator

spec:
...
  clientTLS:
    clientCertificatePolicy: Required
    clientCA:
      name: router-ca-certs-default
    allowedSubjectPatterns:
    - anubis.rober.lab
```

This configuration includes setting a clientCA value, which is a reference to a config map. The config map contains the PEM-encoded CA certificate bundle that is used to verify a client’s certificate.

* After edit the ingress operator we can see that the pods of the ingress / Haproxy are restarting:

```sh
kubectl get pod -n openshift-ingress -w
NAME                              READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
router-default-6f6dfb449d-ltlhv   1/1     Running       0          3d15h
router-default-6f6dfb449d-r5p8z   1/1     Terminating   0          3d15h
router-default-864d7f7f7-dfng2    1/1     Running       0          12s
```

* Let's check the changes in the default ingress-operator including the mtls ones:

```sh
kubectl get IngressController default -n openshift-ingress-operator -o jsonpath='{.spec}' | jq -r .
{
  "clientTLS": {
    "allowedSubjectPatterns": [
      "anubis.rober.lab"
    ],
    "clientCA": {
      "name": "router-ca-certs-default"
    },
    "clientCertificatePolicy": "Required"
  },
  "httpEmptyRequestsPolicy": "Respond",
  "httpErrorCodePages": {
    "name": ""
  },
  "replicas": 2,
  "tuningOptions": {},
  "unsupportedConfigOverrides": null
}
```

On the other hand, as we change the ingress operator to support the mtls the Canary routes used for check the Ingress pods are showing some errors, so need to update their TLS certificate as well:

## 8. Test the OpenShift Ingress Controller with mTLS enabled

Now that we have the mTLS enabled in the ingress-controller, let's execute the example curl as we used in the previous step to check and simulate the connection from a client outside of the OpenShift cluster:

```sh
curl -LIv https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp.rober.lab

curl: (56) OpenSSL SSL_read: error:1409445C:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:tlsv13 alert certificate required, errno 0
```

* As we can see the curl is not successful, and if we check the last part of the output we have an Openssl error:

```sh
curl: (56) OpenSSL SSL_read: error:1409445C:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:tlsv13 alert certificate required, errno 0
```

as we expected the client certificate is requested by the Ingress pods, because it's configured in the ingress controller.

* Let's try with curl and with the proper certificates to execute then the same curl to the ingress controller. We will use:

```sh
curl --cacert certs/cacert.pem --cert certs/client.cert.pem --key private/client.key.pem  -LIv https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp.rober.lab -k

as you can see the client was able to connect to the web server using the client certificate. So this proves the mutual TLS authentication where both server and client are using TLS certificate to prove their identity.

* You can also check this with the openssl util using the private key and the cacert:

```sh
openssl s_client -connect console-openshift-console.apps.ocp.rober.lab:443  -key private/client.key.pem  -cert certs/client.cert.pem -CAfile certs/cacert.pem -state

And with that ends this long blog post about mTLS and Ingress Controller in OpenShift.

Special thanks to my mentor, colleague and friend [Luis Arizmendi](https://github.com/luisarizmendi) for his support, guidance and wisdom (and bugfixing :D) with this feature.

*NOTE: Opinions expressed in this blog are my own and do not necessarily reflect that of the company I work for.*

Happy mTLSing!!
