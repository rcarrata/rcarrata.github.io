I'm Roberto Carratal√°, an IT professional with more than ten years of experience in the industry of Linux, Virtualization, Cloud, DevOps and Kubernetes/OpenShift.

Currently I am working as a **Senior Cloud Services Black Belt for Red Hat**, focused in **OpenShift Cloud Services**, DevSecOps, CICD and Service Mesh, helping the customers to achieve their goals and objectives with linux, cloud and containers in public and private environments.

Although I work for Red Hat I still consider myself a Linux Geek and a Unix fanboy, always searching for new tech to learn and try!

In my free time, I really like basketball (watch and play also!), and spend time with my friends and family.

## Conferences and Events

I enjoy very much the opportunity to speak at conferences and events. These conferences and events are a great opportunity to share my knowledge with other IT professionals, and a good way to connect with them.
