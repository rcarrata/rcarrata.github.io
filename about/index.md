## EMEA Cloud Services Black Belt at Red Hat

I'm Roberto Carratal√°, an IT professional with more than ten years of experience in the industry of Linux, Virtualization, Cloud, DevOps and Kubernetes/OpenShift.

Currently I am working as a **Senior Cloud Services Black Belt for Red Hat**, focused in **OpenShift Cloud Services**, DevSecOps, CICD and Service Mesh, helping the customers to achieve their goals and objectives with linux, cloud and containers in public and private environments.

Although I work for Red Hat I still consider myself a Linux Geek and a Unix fanboy, always searching for new tech to learn and try!

In my free time, I really like basketball (watch and play also!), and spend time with my friends and family.

Opinions expressed in this blog are my own and do not necessarily reflect that of the company I work for.

## Certifications

I'm always trying to learn new things, and I strongly believe that IT Certifications and Courses are a wonderful way to learn, tinker and discover new technologies. These are some of the certifications that I studied and passed in my professional career.
