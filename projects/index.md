I have always made sure that almost all of my personal projects and collaborations, as well as contributions to other projects, are open-sourced and freely accessible to colleagues, peers, and community members. This fosters growth as we share and learn together!

Here are a few projects I'm collaborating on or maintaining, further enhancing the giving-back to the community that has provided us with so much.
